- 👋 Hi! I’m Lisa, a knowledge, documentation and learning guru (she/her/hers).
- 💡 I build thoughtful, custom, learner-centered training and technical documentation with competence and engagement always top of mind.
- 📄 I believe in the power of docs to make concepts accessible for every learner, not just subject matter experts (SMEs).
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of documentation and training projects, large and small.
- 📫 Send me a message at lisa.dellaporta@gmail.com.
